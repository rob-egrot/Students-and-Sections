# Students-and-Sections
This is a series of analyses of anonymized undergrad exam data taken from first and second year applied math courses (one of each) over 8 and 9 years respectively. The main point of the investigation is to look at the effect, if any, of the naming of the sections (essentially classes) the students were arranged into on their exam performances, but there are also digressions to examine the effects of different teachers and online vs onsite exams. The investigations involve both classical and Bayesian methods, implemented in R and stan. The results are presented in 3 Jupyter notebooks, with raw code also available as .R files. The 1st notebook deals with the second year exam data, the 2nd with the first year exam data, and the 3rd combines the data to create a more sophisticated Bayesian model.


Contents:

3 Jupyter notebooks containing analysis. Students.ipynb analyzes the 2nd year data, while Students2.ipynb analyses the 1st year data (numbers here represent the order I did the analyses, so apologies for potentially confusing numbering). Students3.ipynb deals with combined data.

3 .R files with the same names containing the raw R code.

5 .csv files containing the data. 3 files contain the data used in the analyses, and 2 contain the base anonymized data for the two years respectively.

1 Jupyter notebook with the process for merging data for the 3rd analysis.
