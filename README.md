# Students-and-Sections
This is an analysis of (anonymised) data from a compulsory 2nd year undergraduate mathematics course. The primary focus is investigating the effect of section numbering on exam performance using classical and Bayesian methods. Files include the raw data, a jupyter notebook and an R file containing the code from the notebook.

Note: Some of the stan code breaks the jupyter kernel, though it runs fine in e.g. Rstudio. To get around this and produce the relevant output in the notebook I saved models in Rstudio then loaded them in the notebook. These saves are too big for github, but you can recreate them using the .R file.
